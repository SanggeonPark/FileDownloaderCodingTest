# Coding Test : File Downloader
1. Implement Downloader in Project. (Unit test are all requirements.)
2. Implement ViewController with implemented Downloader. (See Warnings, it indicates you what you need to do)
3. Do not use any 3rd party libraries and Frameworks for Network Process! (ex: Alamofire, AFNetworking etc.,)
4. We just want to check your potential, it doesn't matter you can finish the task or not.
5. It's OK even the app crashes ;) Have fun!!
